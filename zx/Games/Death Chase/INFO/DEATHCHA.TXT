DESCRIPTION
This was basicaly a racing game/shoot em up. You are one of an
elite group of mercenaries and you had to patrol various forests
during the day and night. There are 2 enemt bikers you have to
chase and kill for a bounty of $1000, there were also helecopters
and tanks to shoot as well. It was set over 8 levels where each
forest getting more and more dense. When you get past level 8
it's back to the start again.

KEYS
1 - steer left
0 - steer right
8 - decelerate
9 - accelerate
Any key on bottom row - fire photon bolt

Also you can use Kempston joystick

INSTRUCTIONS
You have to chase the enemy bikers until you are in range (the
range indicator will then flash), then you can use your photon
bolts to shoot them. While doing this you have to doge the
oncoming trees. Helecopters and tanks appear on the horizon and
these can also be shot for more money. You also get money if you
survive at high speeds. As soon as you have done a day patrol
(when you have killed the 2 bikers) you proceed to the night
stage which is similar to the day except the trees are harder to
spot. The intructions say that the greatest reward is left to
those who penetrate 8 sectors but I can't tell you what this is
as I never got that far!

CHEATS
Just enter this program, play deathchase past the header, typ RUN
and press play. Gives you invincibility.

NOTABLE FEATURES
The most notable feature is the fact that 3D Deatchase is only
16k long.  It is a very simple game but is highly addictive,
don't play this game as you will not want to play anything again
for weeks! It is also very hard on the later levels, you spend
most of your time avoiding the trees let alone try to shoot the
bikers.  The games blurb boasted about the fact that it was 100%
machine code, Kempston joystick compatable and had the greatest
3d graphics ever!
